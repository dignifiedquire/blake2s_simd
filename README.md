[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oconnor663/blake2s_simd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oconnor663/blake2s_simd)

EXPERIMENTAL implementation of BLAKE2s and BLAKE2sp. Much of the code is
copy-pasted from
[`blake2b_simd`](https://github.com/oconnor663/blake2b_simd), which is a
real project, but this is currently only for benchmarking.

Not stable, and not published on crates.io.
